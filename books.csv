I have no gripes with the plot and enjoyed the science-based color throughout the book (web browsing latency, coffee's low boiling point, etc.). But the dialog was downright awful. Cringe worthy. I went back and forth between giving this book 2 or 3 stars. I made it to the end which in and of itself means it wasn't terrible. And it certainly had its moments. If it wasn't for the face-palm-inducing dialog it would have gotten 4 stars. But, it had said dialog and that dialog heavily distracted from the goodness of the plot. Given this I went with 3 stars. And when reading some of the more obnoxious commentary from Jazz, I debated whether 2 was more deserving. In the end, 3 won out, but it was close. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Don Tillman is a fantastic character. Funny and endearing book. Highly recommended.  <br/><br/>Below is a short excerpt that I see as a great example of Don Tillman hilariousness (this betrays no plot and is in the first 50 pages, so I don't think its a spoiler)....<br/>‘I’m wearing a jacket.’<br/> ‘I’m afraid we require something a little more formal, sir.’ <br/>The hotel employee indicated his own jacket as an example. In defense of what followed, I submit the Oxford English Dictionary definition of ‘jacket’: 1(a) An outer garment for the upper part of the body.  I also note that the word ‘jacket’ appears on the care instructions for my relatively new and perfectly clean Gore-Tex ‘jacket’. But it seemed his definition of jacket was limited to ‘conventional suit jacket’. <br/>‘We would be happy to lend you one, sir. In this style.’ <br/>‘You have a supply of jackets? In every possible size?’ I did not add that the need to maintain such an inventory was surely evidence of their failure to communicate the rule clearly, and that it would be more efficient to improve their wording or abandon the rule altogether. Nor did I mention that the cost of jacket purchase and cleaning must add to the price of their meals. Did their customers know that they were subsidizing a jacket warehouse? <br/>…My Gore-Tex jacket, the high-technology garment that had protected me in rain and snowstorms, was being irrationally, unfairly and obstructively contrasted with the official’s essentially decorative woolen equivalent. I had paid $1,015 for it, including $120 extra for the customized reflective yellow. I outlined my argument. <br/>‘My jacket is superior to yours by all reasonable criteria: impermeability to water, visibility in low light, storage capacity.’ I unzipped the jacket to display the internal pockets and continued, ‘Speed of drying, resistance to food stains, hood ...’ <br/>And it goes on... but you get the idea.  Good stuff!",,,1,,,0,,,,,
